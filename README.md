# Murmur

Murmur is a simple Ollama wrapper that adds a GUI. I didn't do that much research on if there were other good Ollama wrappers or alike, but i wanted to make my own. Also i wanted it to be Open source, so here it is.

## Stack

- Tauri
- Vue
- SurrealDB

## Features

These are the features that i plan to add.

- [x] Chat for rendering markdown answers from the selected Ollama model.
- [ ] A way to select the model to use.
- [ ] Embedded SurrealDB to store former chats.

More features might get added in the future, i don't know yet.
